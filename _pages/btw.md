**Background:**

The general election in 2017 shook up the mainly moderate political landscape in Germany. 
For the first time since the founding of the federal republic after World War II, a far-right party, the so-called "Alternative fur Deutschland" (Alternative for Germany) or AfD, was able to grab hold of seats in the Parliament (Bundestag). Many were quick to blame chancellor Merkel, as her open-borders policy regarding the Syrian refugee crisis was often met with backlash from 
conservative voters. These policies, along with what was seen as a proliferating influence of the European Union on local politics, had many of these voters feel alienated by Merkel's party, the center-right CDU. Data suggests that voters fleeing the CDU were the major contributing factor in the rise of the AfD. As anecdoctal evidence, many AfD voters when questioned about their motives cited a fear of "Uberfremdung" (over-foreignization) and worries about refugee camps being set up in their neighborhoods.

I will let the data speak for itself (images might take a moment to load):
